# Website

Hello! You've probably found this template on YouTube, but if not, you can use [this link](#).

I'm planning on creating a tutorial series covering every aspect of setting up this website. I've been running this website for 5 months without any blocking issues.

If you encounter any problems or need troubleshooting assistance, please visit my Discord server. Also, if you have any video requests, feel free to comment on my newest video in [this playlist](#).

Once again, please remember that this is a website template and it's not perfect.

## **DO NOT TAKE CREDIT**

I want to emphasize that by using this template, I hope that no one takes credit for it or hides its source code. I want this to be open source, available for everyone to use. This also means refraining from selling the site as "Your site".

## **Leave Credit**

It would mean a lot to me if you could leave my username, `CodeDragon`, somewhere on your site. I intentionally made it hard to remove so that people wouldn't take credit for the work. If no one takes credit, I might remove those or make a tutorial on how to do so.

## Thanks for reading!
