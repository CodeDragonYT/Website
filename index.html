    <section id="acids-alkalis">
      <h2>Acids and Alkalis with H+ Protons</h2>
      <p>Delve into the fundamental concepts of acids and alkalis, where H+ protons play a crucial role in
        determining
        their properties and behavior.</p>
      <p>An acid is a substance that releases H+ ions in water, leading to an increase in the concentration of H+
        ions
        and a decrease in pH.</p>
      <p>Common acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), are known for their ability to
        readily donate H+ ions in chemical reactions.</p>
      <p>Alkalis, in contrast, release OH- ions (hydroxide ions) in water and have a pH greater than 7, with
        examples
        like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH).</p>
      <p>The pH scale serves as a measure of the concentration of H+ ions in a solution, with values below 7
        indicating acidity and values above 7 indicating alkalinity.</p>
      <p>Acids and alkalis can neutralize each other, with H+ ions from the acid reacting with OH- ions from the
        alkali to form water.</p>
      <p>Buffer solutions, crucial in maintaining stable pH levels, play a vital role in various chemical and
        biological processes, resisting drastic changes in acidity.</p>
      <p>Understanding the behavior of H+ protons in chemical reactions is foundational in fields such as medicine,
        environmental science, and industrial processes.</p>
